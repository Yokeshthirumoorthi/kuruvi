## Storage as Service

This app stores photo albums in cloud server.

## Build and Deploy Instructions
    - [Deploy docs](../docker-compose)

## Technical Details

Since all the processes are dockerized in this project, it makes more sense to treat each seperate process, while uploading and persisting a file, as a service.

All the files are stored directly to the file system. 

Services required for this functionality are

    1. Front end - with upload button
    2. Back end - that handles the http request and saves the file to disk
    3. filesystem ui - a simple caddy server as reverse proxy

## Security and Previleges

    **TODO**

## Architecture

    **TODO**

## Testing

    Run the album upload test

    ```
    make upload-test-album [path-to-album]
    ```

    After upload goto http://localhost:2015/album-uploads/test-album/uploads

## Metrics

    **TODO**

## TODO
    * It is not necessay to have 3 services. Rather the caddy server should be made as web server for the backend service and deployed in same container.
    * Make frontend as https.
    * Add authentication.
