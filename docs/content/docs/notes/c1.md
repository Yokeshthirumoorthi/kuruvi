## Storage as Service

This app stores photo albums in cloud server.

## Build and Deploy Instructions
    - [Deploy docs](../docker-compose)

## Technical Details

Since all the processes are dockerized in this project, it makes more sense to treat each seperate process, while uploading and persisting a file, as a service.

All the files are stored directly to the file system. 

Services required for this functionality are

    1. Front end - with upload button
    2. Back end - that handles the http request and saves the file to disk
    3. filesystem ui - a simple caddy server
