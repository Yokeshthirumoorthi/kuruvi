# kuruvi
Copyright Â© 2019 Yokesh Thirumoorthi

**WIP. Not ready for production !!!**

**Kuruvi** is a smart photo management app.


When users upload a photo album, this app processes the photos in the album and gets them resized, organized by date, time and location, detect faces and recognize faces. The processed album is then statically serverd back to users via web.


## Build and Deploy Instructions
  - Using [Docker Compose](./docs/content/docs/docker-compose/index.md)
  - Using [Kubernetes](./docs/content/docs/kubernetes/index.md)

## Service Architecture

This project is developed as multi-tier microservices application. Yet each microservice in this app ensures to **Do one thing and do it well**.

All services in Kuruvi is developed using Nodejs (Services will be refactored to Golong in future), and containerized using Docker.

## Features

* Store photo albums securely in cloud
* Organize photos based on time, date and location
* Detect and recognize faces
* Resize photos

## Nice to have features

* Detect and compare faces
* Geolocate the photos on a map
* Share and tag photos with friends
* Identify previously tagged people in images

## Development Principles

The main principles of kuruvi app are Simplicity, Scalability, Speed, and Security.

## Measurements And Beanchmarks

### Profiling & Metrics - Done using Prometheus and Graphana

To deploy Prometheus & Grafana and to setup all the nice graphs that we got ready for you, simply:

```
docker-compose -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```
Wait for the deployment to be ready. Check the status with

```
docker-compose -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml ps
```

Importing The Dashboards
You only need to do this once:

```
  docker-compose \
    -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml \
    run \
    --entrypoint /opt/grafana-import-dashboards/import.sh \
    --rm \
    importer
```

**Accessing The Services**

Once the services are up & running you can access them with the following URLs:

- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000

**Grafana Credentials**

   | Username |	Password |
   | -------- | -------- |
   | admin	| foobar |

* Tracing - Done with zipkin

### Logging - Done using Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK stack)

If you want to run the application using a more advanced logging setup based on Fluentd + ELK stack, you can add the logging compose file to override some settings and add some extra containers:

```
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.logging.yml up -d
```

Once deployed, you should be able to reach Kibana on http://localhost:5601. -->
