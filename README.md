Copyright Â© 2019 Yokesh Thirumoorthi

**WIP. Not ready for production !!!**

**Kuruvi** is a smart photo organizer app. 
Users can upload their unorganized photo albums to get it all resized, organized by day and location, faces cropped and recognized.

## Build and Deploy Instructions
  - Using [Docker Compose](./docs/deploy/docker-compose.md)

## Service Architecture

This project is a multi-tier microservices application.
Each microservice in Kuruvi does one thing and does it well.
Kuruvi is a mostly a Node based application, completly containerized and ready to be installed and used in any Os, using Docker.

## Development Principles

The main principles of kuruvi are simplicity, scalability, speed, and security.

## Measurements And Beanchmarks

### Profiling & Metrics - Done using Prometheus and Graphana

To deploy Prometheus & Grafana and to setup all the nice graphs that we got ready for you, simply:

```
docker-compose -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```
Wait for the deployment to be ready. Check the status with

```
docker-compose -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml ps
```

Importing The Dashboards
You only need to do this once:

```
  docker-compose \
    -f ./deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.monitoring.yml \
    run \
    --entrypoint /opt/grafana-import-dashboards/import.sh \
    --rm \
    importer
```

**Accessing The Services**

Once the services are up & running you can access them with the following URLs:

- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000

**Grafana Credentials**

   | Username |	Password |
   | -------- | -------- |
   | admin	| foobar |

* Tracing - Done with zipkin

### Logging - Done using Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK stack)

If you want to run the application using a more advanced logging setup based on Fluentd + ELK stack, you can add the logging compose file to override some settings and add some extra containers:

```
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.logging.yml up -d
```

Once deployed, you should be able to reach Kibana on http://localhost:5601. -->
