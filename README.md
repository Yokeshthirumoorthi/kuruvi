**WIP. Not ready for production !!!**

This project is a multi-tier microservices application. The application
is a web-based smart photo organization and management app called **Kuruvi**.
Users can upload their unorganized photo albums to get it all resized, faces recognized and
organized into new albums.

## Build and Deploy Instructions

The Kuruvi application is packaged using a Docker Compose file.

### Pre-requisites
* Install Docker
* Install Docker Compose
* (Optional) Install [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/install-weave-scope/)

```
git clone https://github.com/Yokeshthirumoorthi/kuruvi
cd kuruvi
```

### Launch Weave Scope

Weave Scope (local instance)

```
sudo curl -L git.io/scope -o /usr/local/bin/scope
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope
scope launch
```

### Provision infrastructure

```
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

(Optional) Run with Fluentd logging
If you want to run the application using a more advanced logging setup based on Fluentd + ELK stack, you can add the logging compose file to override some settings and add some extra containers:

```
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.logging.yml up -d
```

Once deployed, you should be able to reach Kibana on http://localhost:5601.

### Cleaning up

```
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down
```

## Service Architecture

**Kuruvi** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.
Each microservice in Kuruvi does one thing and does it well.
Kuruvi is a mostly a Node based application, completly containerized and ready to be installed and used in any Os, using Docker.
